The problem that being analyzed is how to try and predict the attrition of valuable employees. 
The aim was to try and uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. It is apart of the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance initiative.
